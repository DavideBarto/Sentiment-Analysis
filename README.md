# Sentiment Analysis for Twitter Posts

## Overview

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on Twitter posts. The goal is to classify tweets into different sentiment categories, such as positive, negative, or neutral. The notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning models to predict the sentiment of unseen tweets.
